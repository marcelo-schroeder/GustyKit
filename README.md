A Cocoa Touch framework to help you develop high quality iOS apps and app extensions faster. GustyKit requires iOS 8 or greater.

GustyKit provides the foundation for [GustyAppKit](https://github.com/marcelo-schroeder/GustyAppKit). If you need foundation functionality that is safe to use by app extensions, then use GustyKit. GustyAppKit provides extra functionality on top of GustyKit that only apps can use (e.g. access to UIApplication).

This framework has been used in a few projects for my clients.

The latest API documentation can be found [here](http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/GustyKit).

Additional documentation and sample code are coming soon.
